	<!-- !Abstract -->
	<abstract>
		<t>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been widely used by the 
		  World Wide Web (WWW) since 1990. This specification attempts to define
		  how to parse HTTP requests and responses in a way that is compatible
		  with user-agents (UAs) and servers at the time of writing.</t>
	</abstract>
</front>
<middle>
	<!-- !Introduction -->
	<section title="Introduction">
		<t>Ever since HTTP's conception, there have never been any standards
		  regarding its parsing in the real world. <xref target="RFC2616"/>
		  tried to improve this situation with a section (19.3) entited 
		  "Tolerant Applications", providing advice about parsing requests and
		  responses. However, it did not go into specific details that are
		  needed for interoperability with current (non-conformant) servers. The
		  lack of any current specification defining such specifics makes it
		  hard for any new UA to be created without first spending large amounts
		  of time reverse engineering what is in cases purely bizzare behaviour,
		  which unless you know about beforehand, you may not write enough test
		  cases to find some of the oddest behaviour.</t>
		
		<t>This specification aims to help the above mentioned problem by
		  documenting the behaviour of UAs at the time of writing. As with any
		  data format without specified error handling, this behaviour is likely
		  to change over time.</t>
		
		<!-- !Requirements Language -->
		<section title="Requirements Language">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
			  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
			  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
			  <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
		</section>
		
		<!-- !Conformance Requirements -->
		<section title="Conformance Requirements">
			<t>This specification is defined in terms of the US-ASCII character
			  set, as defined in <xref target="ANSI.X3-4.1986"/>.</t>
			  
			<t>The conformance requirements of this specification are phrased as
			  algorithms and may be implemented in any manner, so long as the
			  end result is equivalent (in particular, the algorithms defined in
			  this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not
			  intended to be performant).</t>
			
			<t>User agents may impose implementation-specific limits on
			  otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g., to prevent denial of service
			  attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around
			  platform-specific limitations.</t>

	<!-- !Further Suggestions -->
	<appendix title="Further Suggestions">
		<t>This section is informative.</t>
		
		<t>While the scope of this specification is only parsing of HTTP
		  requests and responses, there are several other things that I am aware
		  of that should be pointed out to anyone implementing
		  <xref target="RFC2616"/>:</t>
		
		<list style="symbols">
			<t>The Content-Location header SHOULD be ignored. This is due to
			  multiple versions of Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)
			  sending incorrect Content-Location headers. Implementing this as
			  required by <xref target="RFC2616"/> will break a significant
			  number of websites.</t>
			
			<t>The Content-Type SHOULD NOT on its own be trusted. Content-Type
			  sniffing as defined in <xref target="HTML 5"/>
			  SHOULD be used to determine the true type of the resource. This
			  is due to a large number of websites sending incorrect
			  Content-Type headers, often because the maintainer of the website
			  cannot change the header, or because the file extension/MIME type
			  database is outdated.</t>
